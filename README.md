reformasbascu
=============

My first project as freelance, the contractor was the company *Bascu√±ana: reformas y construcciones*

Mostly, a visual site where the company can show the good quality of work they made. Moreover, it is provided some contact forms and information about them. The company has access to an administration panel where is possible to modify the shown pictures.
